If you are wondering exactly what this kind of engineering is, think about the mother and father from the book Cheaper By the Dozen, written by Ernestine and Frank Gilbreth. They live to squeeze every drop of efficiency from every task, and constantly improve their techniques. Industrial engineers are trained to have a broad perspective of the entire creation pipeline (experimentation, analysis, design, and production/manufacturing). The material, technology, and human aspect are elements taken into account in order to optimize the entire pipeline for heightened efficiency and quality of the product/service.
